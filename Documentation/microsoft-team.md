# Microsoft Team Onboarding

If you are new to Microsoft, you will need to onboard into various GitHub projects in order to get your work done.

## Getting Permissions

There are two main teams to join to get access to Microsoft .NET-related projects.

* [microsoft team - dotnet org](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/dotnet/teams/microsoft/join/)
* [dotnet team - microsoft org](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/Microsoft/teams/dotnet/join/)

Once your permission requests are approved, you should have write permissions to [.NET Core Repos](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/core-repos.md). Everyone using these repos should also be able to @mention you, too.
